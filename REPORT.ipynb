    "After training and evaluating several models, I found that the standard Linear Regression model and the averaged combination of Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet models performed similarly. The regularization techniques, while designed to control model complexity and improve generalization, did not significantly outperform the basic Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Linear Regression model produced an MSE of 23.49 and an R² score of 0.739 on the validation set. When combining the predictions from Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet, I observed almost identical performance metrics. This suggests that the dataset may not have benefited much from regularization, likely because overfitting was not a severe issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, averaging the predictions of the three regularized models did provide a slight improvement in the Kaggle leaderboard scores, particularly in the public score. This indicates that while regularization introduces some robustness to the models, its impact on performance for this dataset was modest."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "While regularized models like Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet are generally effective at improving model performance by controlling overfitting, in this case, their benefit was limited. The similarity in results between Linear Regression and the averaged regularized models suggests that the dataset did not have enough complexity or noise to fully leverage the advantages of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing and averaging the predictions, I found marginal improvements in Kaggle scores, particularly for the public leaderboard. However, the overall gains were small, indicating that in this scenario, regularization provided only modest improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Final Scores:***\n",
    "Linear Regression performed consistently with both private and public Kaggle scores.\n",
    "Averaging predictions from Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet led to slightly better generalization, as reflected in the public leaderboard scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Next Steps:***\n",
    "For future improvements, additional feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and potentially more advanced algorithms could further enhance the performance."
